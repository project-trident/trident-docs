Ethical Advertising Policy
--------------------------

For many years, users have wanted to give back to the |trueos| project.
Generally, we encouraged users to donate or actively contribute to the
FreeBSD project to ensure FreeBSD continues to be successful in the
future. Because |trueos| is open source software, we have included a
minimal number of ads as a simple method for users to give back to the
project, if they wish.

The primary consideration for these ads is to avoid detracting from the
user experience as much as possible. To this end, any ads in the
Handbook will be limited to the navigation sidebar, and only in a
predefined space underneath all other navigation options. We are
resolved to protect user privacy and security, and do not collect user
information, with the exception of click-throughs. Furthermore, we do
not collect any data for targeted ads, and are committed to only show
high quality ads pertaining to our user base.

**Cookie Policy**

Clicking on a Newegg ad directs users through an affiliate link that
gives the |trueos| project a modest commission based on any items
purchased within 24 hours. This is a simple time tracking cookie used to
ensure the |trueos| project is afforded its commission. To ask questions
about our Ethical Advertising policy, please contact <joshms@trueos.org>
for more information.
